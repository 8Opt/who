## :memo: Golang's Interface

In Go (Golang), there are no "classes" like in Python, Java, or C++. Instead, Go uses:
+ structs: These are used to group data together (like fields or attributes).
+ methods: These are functions that are attached to a struct. They can work with the data inside the struct.

Go also has interfaces, which are just a list of method names.
To "implement" an interface, a struct needs to have all the methods listed in that interface.

When you call a method from an interface, you can pass a variable of a struct type â€” as long as that struct has already implemented the needed methods.
